<h1>Job listings with filtering</h1>
 
<h2>Brief</h2>

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so you can use that to populate the content on the first load if you like.

Your users should be able to:

<ul>
<li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
<li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
<li>Filter job listings based on the categories selected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Links</h2>

<ul>
<li>Live site: https://gilded-froyo-db79c5.netlify.app/</li>
</ul>
